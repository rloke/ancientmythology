    "P1":	"The world is filled with mind-blowing ancient sites and wonders out there. Over the thousands of years of human history, we’ve produced some pretty amazing stuff, even if, sadly, not all of it has last until today."
    },
	{
	"P2":	"With many breathtaking and incredible historical sites built by ancient civilizations, it’s sometimes hard to narrow down the best. Think of all the lists of ancient wonders out there and how different they are. What criteria do you judge on? What makes a good historical site? What makes the best?"
    },
    {
    "P3":	"Everyone has their own criteria in deciding what ancient places are good or aren’t good. I’ve spent the last decade traveling around the world and have visited a dozen countries. I’ve seen a good few ancient sites and monuments in the world and have plans to see more."
    },
    {
    "P4":	"On this site, these are some of my favorite ancient sites that I think every traveler should try to visit at some point. The story these ruins tell is part of humanity’s story. They guess a deep understanding of our history, power, commonalities, and shared experiences. They show us how we’ve developed as a species. Don’t miss out seeing them if you ever get a chance!"
